# Experiments

This is the **menu** of candidate experiments, organized by which
fundamental each primarily probes. The list is not an ordering.
Experiments are picked from the menu based on what is most interesting
to learn next. Numbering is sequential by start time; gaps are
fine.

Items without an `NNNN` prefix are candidates not yet started.

## Conventions

- Experiment slugs: `NNNN-<kebab-case-slug>`, zero-padded 4-digit
  number.
- `Status` in each experiment's README: `in-progress`, `complete`, or
  `abandoned`.
- After completion, the experiment is frozen. Later experiments may
  reference it but do not modify it.

## Wire protocol fidelity

**`0001-raw-http-aggregation`** — hand-rolled Go `net/http` probe. No
`k8s.io/apiserver`. Tests the minimum wire contract the aggregation
layer and kubectl actually demand. Status: complete. See
`FINDINGS/0001-raw-http-aggregation.md`.

- `hello-aggregated` — smallest real aggregated apiserver using
  `k8s.io/apiserver`. Read/write Hello resource, watch via
  `watch.NewBroadcaster`, synthetic resourceVersion.
- `argocd-compat` — install ArgoCD into the kind cluster, point at
  an Application referencing our API, observe what works/breaks.
- `flux-compat` — same with Flux.
- `ssa-probe` — deliberately attempt server-side apply. Observe what
  breaks, what works, what the field-manager story looks like.
- `protobuf-probe` — can we serve `application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf`
  for basic kinds? Does it matter?
- `openapi-explain-minimum` — narrow probe: what is the minimum
  OpenAPI v3 shape that makes `kubectl explain` work? Derived from
  `0001`'s observation that `explain` fails on a structurally-valid
  but GVR-less schema.
- `watch-table-rendering` — (consequent-leaning) why does kubectl's
  `-w` mode render a different table schema between renders when
  only `BOOKMARK`s are emitted? Does emitting real `MODIFIED` events
  smooth it out? Derived from `0001`.

## Identity handoff

- `custom-authorizer-external-policy` — custom `authorizer.Authorizer`
  that consults an external HTTP policy service on every request.
  Proves per-request identity-based authz end-to-end.
- `github-driver-static-pat` — aggregated API exposing GitHub repos
  using a single static PAT. Identity is *observed* in logs, not yet
  forwarded.
- `identity-broker-github-app` — broker holding a GitHub App key;
  exchanges caller identity for a scoped installation token per
  request. The real identity-forwarding pattern.
- `oidc-federation` — kube-apiserver configured with structured
  authentication config to federate GitHub OIDC tokens; our AA
  observes GitHub claims arriving in `user.Info.Extra`.
- `extra-header-smuggling` — (consequent-leaning) what can round-trip
  through `X-Remote-Extra-*`? Includes a threat model.

## Storage independence

- `fs-driver` — filesystem files exposed as a Kubernetes resource;
  fsnotify-driven watch; real writes to disk.
- `in-memory-hello` — hello-level AA with ephemeral in-memory state
  and broadcaster-based watch. Likely subsumed by `hello-aggregated`.
- `external-db-driver` — postgres-backed driver; real resourceVersion
  derived from a sequence.

## Per-request authorization

- `custom-authorizer-external-policy` — (listed under identity
  handoff; probes both fundamentals).
- `authorizer-cel` — CEL expressions evaluated per-request against
  identity + request attributes. Compare to RBAC's declarative shape.
- `sar-delegation-compare` — compare AA with delegated
  `SubjectAccessReview` authz vs. AA with custom authorizer. Observe
  what each enables and constrains.
- `rbac-permissive-aa` — AA deployed with permissive upstream
  ClusterRole so the AA's authorizer becomes the real decision point.
  Probes "can-i" / SelfSubjectRulesReview UX when authz happens in
  the AA, not RBAC. Derived from `0001`'s observation that RBAC gates
  requests before they reach the AA.

## Resource modeling freedom

- `extract-runtime` — factor a `Driver` interface out of two
  experiments that demanded the same shape. Precondition: at least
  two drivers exist (e.g. `fs-driver` and `github-driver-static-pat`).
- `http-driver` — generic HTTP endpoint as a Kubernetes resource.
  The "anything as a resource" stress test.
- `grpc-as-resource` — expose a gRPC service through aggregation.
- `virtual-composition` — an AA that projects a join of two underlying
  resources (kcp-style virtual workspace).

## Watch and consistency semantics

- `watch-broadcaster-substrate` — real synthetic-watch implementation
  with monotonic RV and bookmarks. Likely arrives as part of
  `hello-aggregated`.
- `long-lived-informer` — controller-runtime informer sustained past
  the relist boundary. Observe 410-Gone handling and recovery.
- `cert-rotation-under-watch` — serving cert rotates mid-watch;
  observe client behavior.

---

## Consequent probes (worth doing; don't generalize)

- `extra-header-smuggling` — (listed under identity handoff).
- `openapi-aggregation-cost` — measure aggregator overhead as schema
  size grows.
- `availability-impact` — AA goes down; observe effect on kubectl,
  discovery cache refresh, and cluster-wide API latency.

## MVP-example track

**`example-e1-github-repos`** — the MVP-example scenario. `kubectl
get repos` returns the caller's GitHub repos; identity-aware authz
gates access; `kubectl get repos -w` streams updates. FINDINGS file
documents what the exercise revealed.

This is a composition of several lab experiments; it lands only
after its prerequisites are available (a real AA, a custom
authorizer, the github driver, and watch).
